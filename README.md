## About KIO API

KIO is the application programming interface (API) used in several of my projects, including KIO WEB. This API serves as the backend for a point-of-sale (POS) system for a fictional business. It includes key features such as product ordering for both customers and the back office, inventory management, a kitchen/warehouse view to track orders in progress, and a restaurant view displaying completed orders.
