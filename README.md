## About KIO API

This KIO project is the application programming interface (API) used in several of my projects, including KIO WEB, KIO NATIVE and KIO APP. This API serves as the backend for a point-of-sale (POS) system for a fictional business. It includes key features such as product ordering for both customers and the back office, inventory management, a kitchen/warehouse view to track orders in progress, and a restaurant view displaying completed orders.

This API will be utilized in several of my projects, including **KIO WEB**, **KIO NATIVE**, and **KIO APP**. Currently, **KIO WEB** is the only project under development. You can find the repository for **KIO WEB** on my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/antgire/kio-web).
